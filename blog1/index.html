            <p>The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) has quietly corrected a controversial feature in its PakID mobile app after widespread criticism and confusion.</p>
            <p>The issue first came to light earlier this month when ProPakistani reported that the app’s “Cancel Identity Due to Death” service offered two choices: one for relatives of the deceased and another labeled “Myself.”</p>
            <p>Selecting the latter required users to undergo a liveness check through facial recognition — raising questions about how a deceased individual could possibly verify their own death.</p>

        <div>
            <p>The unusual option quickly went viral on social media, drawing mockery and highlighting apparent flaws in the app’s design.</p>
            <p>After the matter gained traction and following inquiries from media outlets, NADRA moved to correct the feature. The authority has now removed the “myself” option and replaced it with an updated process that requires relatives to confirm their relationship before canceling the ID card of a deceased family member.</p>

            <p>The new version of the app also integrates a family tree feature to make the process more streamlined and less prone to confusion. A NADRA spokesperson said the self-reporting option had been the result of “confusion” and emphasized that the service was always intended for relatives, not the deceased themselves.</p>
